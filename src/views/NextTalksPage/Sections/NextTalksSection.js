            abstract: "<p>The quantum vortices of a superfluid are described as nodal lines of a solution to the time-dependent "
            +"Gross-Pitaevskii equation. Experiments in Lab and extensive numerical computations show that quantum "
            +"vortices cross, each of them breaking into two parts and exchanging part of itself for part of the other. "
            +"This phenomenon, known as quantum vortex reconnection, occurs even though the superfluid does not lose "
            +"its smoothness. This usually leads to a change of topology of the quantum vortices. In this talk I will "
            +"show that, given any initial and final congurations of quantum vortices (i.e. closed curves, possibly "
            +"knotted and linked), and any way of transforming one into the other through a generic pseudo-Seifert "
            +"surface embedded in spacetime, there is an initial condition whose associatedsolution realizes this "
            +"specific vortex reconnection scenario. This allows us to track the vortex reconnection process at all "
